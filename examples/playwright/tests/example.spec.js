// This spec file is generated by Playwright during installation.

// We have added the Playwright command to take a screenshot. The path param
// specify where to save the image.

// We store the screenshot to the "screenshots" folder. The folder will be
// upload to Argos by the CI.

// We have added the `browserName` to the `path` to avoid override when
// puppeteer launch the test on multiple browsers.

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);

  // create a locator
  const getStarted = page.locator("text=Get Started");

  // Expect an attribute "to be strictly equal" to the value.
  await expect(getStarted).toHaveAttribute("href", "/docs/intro");

  // Click the get started link.

  // Expects the URL to contain intro.
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*intro/);
